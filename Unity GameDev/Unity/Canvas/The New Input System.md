# Part 1: Core Concepts

## What Is The New Input System?

The New Input System is a **Unity Package** — it is not built into the Unity engine core.
You install it from the Package Manager.
It replaces the old `Input.GetKey()` approach.

It has four layers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  LAYER 4 — Visual Editor (UI)                           │
│  The three-column editor you use to set up inputs       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  LAYER 3 — JSON Data (.inputactions file)               │
│  Stores your action maps, actions, and bindings         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  LAYER 2 — C# Package (UnityEngine.InputSystem)         │
│  All the classes you work with in code                  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  LAYER 1 — C++ Native Engine (Hidden)                   │
│  Polls the physical hardware every frame                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

You only ever touch **Layers 2, 3, and 4**.
Layer 1 is invisible and automatic.

## The Class Hierarchy

Everything in the Input System follows this containment hierarchy:

```
InputActionAsset          ← ScriptableObject, the .inputactions file
  └── InputActionMap      ← Groups actions by context ("Player", "UI")
        └── InputAction   ← One logical game event ("Jump", "Move", "Link")
              └── InputBinding  ← Links the action to a physical key/button
                    └── InputControl  ← The actual key/button on the device
```

**Plain English:**
- An **Asset** holds everything.
- A **Map** is a group of related actions (like a "mode" of your game).
- An **Action** is something your player can do ("Jump").
- A **Binding** says which physical button triggers that action (`<Keyboard>/space`).
- A **Control** is the runtime representation of that physical button.

When you create an Input Action Asset via UI, Unity creates a `.inputactions` file that looks like this internally:
```json
{
  "name": "PlayerControls",
  "maps": [
    {
      "name": "Player",
      "actions": [
        {
          "name": "Move",
          "type": "Value",
          "expectedControlType": "Vector2"
        },
        {
          "name": "Jump",
          "type": "Button"
        }
      ],
      "bindings": [
        {
          "path": "<Keyboard>/space",
          "action": "Jump",
          "groups": "Keyboard&Mouse"
        },
        {
          "path": "<Keyboard>/w",
          "action": "Move/up",
          "groups": "Keyboard&Mouse"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "controlSchemes": [
    {
      "name": "Keyboard&Mouse",
      "devices": [
        {"devicePath": "<Keyboard>"},
        {"devicePath": "<Mouse>"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```
*This JSON is loaded at runtime and converted into C# objects* (`InputActionMap`, `InputAction`, `InputBinding`).

---

## The Core Classes Explained

### `InputActionAsset`
**What it is:** A `ScriptableObject` that stores your entire input configuration.
**Where it lives:** As a `.inputactions` file in your Project Assets.
**What it contains:** Multiple `InputActionMap` objects.

```csharp
// Reference it in Inspector or load it
public InputActionAsset controls;

// Enable/disable all maps at once
controls.Enable();
controls.Disable();

// Find a specific map
InputActionMap playerMap = controls.FindActionMap("Player");
```

---

### `InputActionMap`
**What it is:** A named container for a group of `InputAction` objects.
**Why it exists:** Different game states need different inputs.
  - "Player" map: Move, Jump, Attack
  - "UI" map: Navigate, Submit, Cancel
  - "Vehicle" map: Accelerate, Steer, Brake

Only **one map should be active** at a time in most games.

```csharp
InputActionMap playerMap = controls.FindActionMap("Player");
playerMap.Enable();   // activate all actions in this group
playerMap.Disable();  // deactivate all actions in this group
```

---

### [[InputAction in New Input System]]
**What it is:** Represents one logical thing a player can do.
**Three types:**

| Type | Use case | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `Button` | Press/release events | Jump, Fire |
| `Value` | Continuous value with change | Move (Vector2), Aim |
| `PassThrough` | Like Value but allows multiple devices at once | Multiplayer |

**Three phases of an action:**

```
started   → The input begins    (e.g., key starts being held)
performed → The interaction completes (e.g., key is pressed fully)
canceled  → The input ends      (e.g., key released)
```

**You subscribe to phases:**
```csharp
jumpAction.performed += OnJump;   // subscribe
jumpAction.performed -= OnJump;   // unsubscribe (important in OnDisable!)
```

---

### `InputBinding`
**What it is:** A struct that stores the **path string** linking an action to a control.

```
Action "Jump"
  ├── Binding: "<Keyboard>/space"      ← keyboard spacebar
  └── Binding: "<Gamepad>/buttonSouth" ← gamepad A button
```

The path `"<Keyboard>/space"` is just a string at design time.
At runtime, Unity resolves it into an actual `InputControl` object.

---

### `InputControl`
**What it is:** The runtime object representing one physical input (one key, one stick axis, one button).

You rarely use `InputControl` directly.
It is what the Input System queries to read hardware state.

Examples:
- `Keyboard.current.spaceKey` → the spacebar's `ButtonControl`
- `Gamepad.current.leftStick` → the left stick's `StickControl`
- `Mouse.current.position` → mouse position `Vector2Control`

---

### `InputDevice`
**What it is:** Represents a physical hardware device.

```csharp
// Access current devices directly
Keyboard keyboard = Keyboard.current;
Mouse mouse = Mouse.current;
Gamepad gamepad = Gamepad.current;

// Check a specific key without InputAction
if (Keyboard.current.spaceKey.wasPressedThisFrame)
    Debug.Log("Space pressed!");

// List all connected devices
foreach (InputDevice device in InputSystem.devices)
    Debug.Log(device.name);
```

`InputDevice` is the parent class. `Keyboard`, `Mouse`, `Gamepad` are subclasses.

---

### `InputSystem` (static class)
**What it is:** The global manager — think of it as the control room.
**It is static** — you call it like `InputSystem.AddDevice(...)`.

Key things you can do:
```csharp
// Get all connected devices
InputSystem.devices;

// React when any device connects or disconnects
InputSystem.onDeviceChange += (device, change) => {
    Debug.Log($"Device {device.name}: {change}");
};

// Add a virtual device (useful for testing)
var keyboard = InputSystem.AddDevice<Keyboard>();

// Remove a device
InputSystem.RemoveDevice(device);
```

In most games, you **never call `InputSystem` directly** — the package manages it for you.

---

## How Path Resolution Works

When you write `"<Keyboard>/space"` as a binding, here is exactly what Unity does at runtime:

```
Step 1: Parse "<Keyboard>"
        → Search InputSystem.devices for a device of type Keyboard
        → Found: Keyboard.current

Step 2: Parse "/space"
        → Query Keyboard.current for a child control named "space"
        → Found: ButtonControl (the spacebar)

Step 3: Each frame, read the ButtonControl's state
        → isPressed? wasPressedThisFrame? → trigger the action
```

This means:
- Bindings are **data** (strings), not hardcoded control references.
- You can **rebind at runtime** by changing the path string — no code change needed.
- If no matching device exists, the binding simply doesn't fire.

---

# Part 2: The PlayerInput Component

## What Is PlayerInput?

`PlayerInput` is a **Unity Component** — you add it to a `GameObject` in the Inspector.

In Unity's object hierarchy:
```
Object                ← Everything in Unity
  └── Component       ← Attached to GameObjects
        └── Behaviour ← Components that can be enabled/disabled
              └── MonoBehaviour     ← Standard Unity script base
                    └── PlayerInput ← THIS — a built-in Unity component
```

It is **not** a GameObject. It is **not** a Manager script you write.
It is a pre-built component from the Input System package.

---

## What Does PlayerInput Do?

`PlayerInput` is the **bridge** between your `.inputactions` asset and your code.

Without it, you must:
1. Load the asset manually
2. Find the right action
3. Subscribe to callbacks
4. Enable/disable everything yourself

So how will it all look without the PlayerInput?

With it, you just:
1. Drag the asset into the `Actions` field in the Inspector
2. PlayerInput handles enabling, subscribing, and routing callbacks

**But how would it look without any PlayerInput attached to the GameObject?**
[[Using Unity's New Input System Without PlayerInput]]

---

## PlayerInput Key Properties

| Property | Type | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| `actions` | `InputActionAsset` | The .inputactions asset assigned in Inspector |
| `currentActionMap` | `InputActionMap` | The currently active action map |
| `notificationBehavior` | `PlayerNotifications` | How callbacks are sent to your code |
| `camera` | `Camera` | Used for split-screen multiplayer |
| `playerIndex` | `int` | Index when using PlayerInputManager for multiplayer |
| `splitScreenIndex` | `int` | Split-screen area index |
| `controlScheme` | `string` | Name of the active control scheme |
| `hasMissingRequiredDevices` | `bool` | True if required device is not connected |

---

## PlayerInput Key Methods

```csharp
// Switch to a different action map by name
playerInput.SwitchCurrentActionMap("UI");

// Activate a specific control scheme
playerInput.SwitchCurrentControlScheme("Gamepad", Gamepad.current);

// Pause/resume all input processing
playerInput.DeactivateInput();
playerInput.ActivateInput();
```

---

## PlayerNotifications — How Callbacks Reach Your Code

This is the `notificationBehavior` property. It controls **how** PlayerInput tells your code that an action fired.

There are four modes:

### Mode 1: `SendMessages` (Default)
PlayerInput calls `SendMessage("OnActionName", value)` on the **same GameObject**.
The PlayerInput gives the list of all the methods that it'll call as a callback. The callback method had to be on a component attached to the GameObject on which we have enabled the player input.

![[Pasted image 20260518214301.png]]

```
PlayerInput fires "Jump" action
  → Calls SendMessage("OnJump", value)
  → Unity searches every component on THIS GameObject
  → Finds your method: public void OnJump(InputValue value)
  → Calls it
```

**Rule:** Your method must be `public`, on the **same GameObject**, named `On` + ActionName.

```csharp
// This is automatically called — you don't connect it anywhere
public void OnJump(InputValue value)
{
    if (value.isPressed) Jump();
}

public void OnMove(InputValue value)
{
    moveDir = value.Get<Vector2>();
}
```

### Mode 2: `BroadcastMessages`
Same as `SendMessages` but also searches **child GameObjects**.

Use this when your handler script is on a child object, not the same object as PlayerInput.

### Mode 3: `InvokeUnityEvents`
PlayerInput exposes **UnityEvents** in the Inspector.
You drag your script's method into the event slot manually.

```
In Inspector:
PlayerInput component
  └── Events
        └── Player
              └── Jump: [drag script here] → OnLinkPerformed()
```

Your callback signature must be:
```csharp
public void OnLinkPerformed(InputAction.CallbackContext context)
{
    if (context.performed) ActivateLink();
}
```

### Mode 4: `InvokeCSharpEvents`
PlayerInput exposes C# events you subscribe to in code.

```csharp
playerInput.onActionTriggered += OnAnyAction;

void OnAnyAction(InputAction.CallbackContext context)
{
    if (context.action.name == "Jump") Jump();
}
```

---

## Multiple InputActionAssets

Can you have multiple `.inputactions` assets?
**Yes.** But only one `PlayerInput` component can have one asset at a time.

Common patterns:

**Pattern A — One asset, multiple maps (recommended)**
```
PlayerControls.inputactions
  ├── Player map    (Movement, Jump, Attack)
  ├── UI map        (Navigate, Submit, Cancel)
  └── Vehicle map   (Accelerate, Steer, Brake)
```
Switch with: `playerInput.SwitchCurrentActionMap("Vehicle")`

**Pattern B — Multiple assets, one PlayerInput**
You can swap the entire `actions` asset at runtime:
```csharp
playerInput.actions = newAsset;  // replace the whole asset
```

**Pattern C — Multiple PlayerInput components (multiplayer)**
Each player GameObject gets its own `PlayerInput` with its own asset.
Use `PlayerInputManager` to manage this automatically.

---

## Switching Action Maps

```csharp
// Via PlayerInput component
GetComponent<PlayerInput>().SwitchCurrentActionMap("UI");

// Via InputActionAsset directly
controls.FindActionMap("Player").Disable();
controls.FindActionMap("UI").Enable();

// Via generated C# class
controls.Player.Disable();
controls.UI.Enable();
```

**Important rule:** When using `PlayerInput`, call `SwitchCurrentActionMap()` — it handles enabling/disabling cleanly. Don't manually enable/disable maps when PlayerInput is managing them.

---

# Part 3: How Your Code Works

## The Setup

Your project uses two scripts:

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ GameObject: "GameManager" (DontDestroyOnLoad) │
│   ├── InputManager.cs   (your script)         │
│   └── PlayerInput       (Unity component)     │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ GameObject: "Player"                          │
│   └── InputEventHandler.cs  (your script)     │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

`InputManager` sits alongside `PlayerInput` on the same GameObject.
`InputEventHandler` is on the player — it reads clean state from `InputManager`.

---

## InputManager.cs — Line by Line

```csharp
public class InputManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Singleton — only one InputManager exists across all scenes
    public static InputManager Instance { get; private set; }

    // These are the "clean" input states other scripts can read
    public Vector2 MoveInput { get; private set; }
    public bool IsJumping { get; private set; }
    public bool IsLinkActive { get; private set; }
```

**Why a singleton?**
Any script anywhere needs to read input.
A singleton means you just call `InputManager.Instance.MoveInput` from anywhere.

---

```csharp
    private void Awake()
    {
        if (Instance != null && Instance != this) { Destroy(gameObject); return; }
        Instance = this;
        DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject);
        playerInput = GetComponent<PlayerInput>();
    }
```

**What happens here:**
1. First time Awake runs: `Instance` is null → this becomes the singleton.
2. If a second InputManager ever loads: it destroys itself.
3. `DontDestroyOnLoad` keeps this alive across scene changes.
4. `GetComponent<PlayerInput>()` grabs the PlayerInput on this same GameObject.

---

```csharp
    public void OnMove(InputValue value)
    {
        MoveInput = value.Get<Vector2>();
    }

    public void OnJump(InputValue value)
    {
        IsJumping = value.isPressed;
    }

    public void OnLink(InputValue value)
    {
        IsLinkActive = value.isPressed;
    }
```

**What happens here — the key magic:**

1. PlayerInput component fires the "Move" action (player pressed WASD).
2. PlayerInput's `notificationBehavior` is set to `SendMessages`.
3. `SendMessage("OnMove", inputValue)` is called on this GameObject.
4. Unity finds `public void OnMove(InputValue value)` — because the name matches.
5. The method stores the clean `Vector2` in `MoveInput`.
6. Any other script can now read `InputManager.Instance.MoveInput`.

**The naming rule is non-negotiable with SendMessage:**
Action name `"Move"` → method must be `OnMove`
Action name `"Link"` → method must be `OnLink`
Action name `"Jump"` → method must be `OnJump`

---

```csharp
    public void SwitchToMap(string mapName)
    {
        playerInput.SwitchCurrentActionMap(mapName);
        currentMapName = mapName;
    }
```

**What happens:** PlayerInput disables the current map, enables the named map.
After this call, only actions from the new map will fire.

---

## InputEventHandler.cs — Line by Line

```csharp
public class InputEventHandler : MonoBehaviour
{
    private void Update()
    {
        HandleMovement();
        HandleLink();
    }
```

**Why Update() here, not a callback?**
Movement is continuous — the player holds a key and the character keeps moving.
Polling `MoveInput` every frame is correct for this.
Callbacks are better for one-shot events like jump or attack.

---

```csharp
    private void HandleMovement()
    {
        Vector2 moveDir = InputManager.Instance.MoveInput;
        rb.linearVelocity = new Vector2(moveDir.x * moveSpeed, rb.linearVelocity.y);
    }
```

**What happens:**
1. Every frame, read the current `MoveInput` from `InputManager`.
2. `InputManager.MoveInput` was set by `OnMove()` when the action fired.
3. Apply it as velocity.

No direct contact with the Input System at all — clean separation.

---

```csharp
    public void OnLinkPerformed(InputAction.CallbackContext context)
    {
        if (context.performed) ActivateLink();
    }
```

**This method is wired via UnityEvents (InvokeUnityEvents mode).**

In the Inspector, on the PlayerInput component:
```
Events → Player → Link (performed): [drag InputEventHandler here] → OnLinkPerformed
```

This method takes `CallbackContext` — explained in detail in Part 4.

---

## The Full Flow — What Happens When Player Presses Space

```
Frame N: Player presses Spacebar
│
├─ C++ layer detects key change
│
├─ Input Update Phase (before Update()):
│    InputSystem checks "Jump" action bindings
│    Finds: "<Keyboard>/space" → space is pressed
│    Triggers "Jump" action → phase: performed
│
├─ PlayerInput (on GameManager) receives the trigger
│    notificationBehavior = SendMessages
│    Calls: SendMessage("OnJump", inputValue)
│
├─ InputManager.OnJump(value) runs:
│    IsJumping = value.isPressed  → IsJumping = true
│
└─ Your Update() runs:
     Can now read InputManager.Instance.IsJumping == true
```

# Part 4: Common Questions Answered

## Q1: How does generating a C# class work? Does it stay in sync?

**Short answer:** No, it does NOT auto-sync. You must regenerate it manually.

**What happens when you click "Generate C# Class":**
1. Unity reads your current `.inputactions` JSON.
2. It generates a `.cs` file with wrapper properties.
3. Example output for a "Jump" action in "Player" map:

```csharp
// This is the GENERATED class — you did not write this
public class PlayerControls : IInputActionCollection2, IDisposable
{
    public InputActionAsset asset { get; }

    // Strongly-typed access to the "Player" map
    public @Player @Player => new @Player(this);

    public struct @Player
    {
        // Strongly-typed access to the "Jump" action
        public InputAction @Jump => m_Wrapper.asset["Player/Jump"];
    }
}
```

**Usage in your code:**
```csharp
private PlayerControls controls;

void Awake()
{
    controls = new PlayerControls();            // loads the JSON
    controls.Player.Jump.performed += OnJump;  // type-safe, IntelliSense works!
}

void OnEnable()  { controls.Enable(); }
void OnDisable() { controls.Disable(); }
```

**Why use it?**
- Auto-complete works — `controls.Player.Jump` instead of `FindAction("Jump")`
- Compile-time error if you mistype a name
- Cleaner code

**The catch — it does NOT auto-update:**
```
You add new "Dash" action via UI editor
↓
The .inputactions JSON is updated
↓
The generated .cs file is NOT updated (it's stale)
↓
controls.Player.Dash → compile error! Property doesn't exist yet
↓
You must click "Generate C# Class" again to regenerate
```

**So is the generated class its own InputActionMap?**
No. It is a **wrapper/facade** over the same underlying asset.
`new PlayerControls()` loads the JSON and creates the same `InputActionMap`/`InputAction` objects internally.
The generated class just gives you typed access to them.

---

## Q2: What is CallbackContext?

`InputAction.CallbackContext` is a **struct** passed to your callback method.
It is a snapshot of everything about the input event at the moment it fired.

```csharp
void OnJump(InputAction.CallbackContext context)
{
    // Which phase fired?
    bool started   = context.started;    // key just began pressing
    bool performed = context.performed;  // key fully pressed (or threshold met)
    bool canceled  = context.canceled;   // key released

    // Which action triggered this?
    InputAction action = context.action;   // the Jump action object
    string actionName  = context.action.name;  // "Jump"

    // Which device/control fired it?
    InputControl control = context.control;    // e.g., Keyboard.space
    InputDevice device   = context.control.device; // the Keyboard device

    // Read the value
    float value = context.ReadValue<float>();    // 0 or 1 for a button
    Vector2 vec = context.ReadValue<Vector2>();  // for Move action
}
```

**Why does it exist?**
A single callback method can handle all three phases.
Without `context`, you wouldn't know if the input started, completed, or stopped.

**Typical usage:**
```csharp
// Button action — act on press only
jumpAction.performed += ctx => Jump();

// Value action — read the value
moveAction.performed += ctx => {
    moveDir = ctx.ReadValue<Vector2>();
};

// Handle all phases in one method
jumpAction.started   += ctx => Debug.Log("jump started");
jumpAction.performed += ctx => Jump();
jumpAction.canceled  += ctx => Debug.Log("jump canceled");
```

---

## Q3: How does Unity know when to call `OnLinkPerformed`? It's never referenced anywhere.

**This depends on which notification mode you use.**

### If using SendMessages:
Unity uses C#'s **reflection** system.

When the "Link" action fires, PlayerInput does this internally:
```csharp
// Inside PlayerInput source code (simplified):
gameObject.SendMessage("OnLink", inputValue, SendMessageOptions.DontRequireReceiver);
```

`SendMessage` scans every component on the GameObject.
It looks for any method named `"OnLink"` using reflection.
If found — calls it. If not found — silently skips (DontRequireReceiver).

Your method is "discovered" automatically at runtime, not at compile time.
This is why you never need to wire it up — Unity finds it by name.

### If using InvokeUnityEvents:
You explicitly drag your method into the Inspector.
```
PlayerInput Inspector
  └── Events
        └── Player
              └── Link (performed): InputEventHandler → OnLinkPerformed
```

PlayerInput stores this reference and calls it directly.
No reflection involved — it's a stored delegate.

**Why is InvokeUnityEvents more reliable?**
- Compile-time safety: if you rename the method, the Inspector reference breaks (you'll see it).
- With SendMessages: if you rename `OnLink` to something else, it silently stops working.

---

## Q4: What does `InputValue` vs `CallbackContext` mean?

These are two different signatures for input callbacks.

| | `InputValue` | `CallbackContext` |
|---|---|---|
| Used with | `SendMessages` mode | `InvokeUnityEvents` or direct subscription |
| Phase info | Only fires at `performed` | Fires at started/performed/canceled |
| Read value | `value.Get<T>()` | `context.ReadValue<T>()` |
| Example | `OnJump(InputValue v)` | `OnJump(CallbackContext ctx)` |

```csharp
// SendMessages signature (InputValue)
public void OnJump(InputValue value)
{
    if (value.isPressed) Jump();  // only fires when performed
}

// InvokeUnityEvents / direct subscription signature (CallbackContext)
public void OnJump(InputAction.CallbackContext context)
{
    if (context.performed) Jump();
}
```

---

## Q5: How to switch between different action maps?

```csharp
// Method 1 — Via PlayerInput component (recommended when using PlayerInput)
GetComponent<PlayerInput>().SwitchCurrentActionMap("UI");

// Method 2 — Via the InputActionAsset directly
playerInput.actions.FindActionMap("Player").Disable();
playerInput.actions.FindActionMap("UI").Enable();

// Method 3 — Via generated C# class
controls.Player.Disable();
controls.UI.Enable();
```

**Practical example — opening a menu:**
```csharp
void OpenMenu()
{
    playerInput.SwitchCurrentActionMap("UI");
    // Now WASD moves menu cursor, not character
    // Jump button submits, not jumps
}

void CloseMenu()
{
    playerInput.SwitchCurrentActionMap("Player");
    // Back to normal player controls
}
```

---

## Q6: How do multiple InputActionAssets work?

**One asset is usually enough** — use multiple maps within one asset.

If you truly need multiple assets:

```csharp
[SerializeField] private InputActionAsset playerAsset;
[SerializeField] private InputActionAsset vehicleAsset;

private PlayerInput playerInput;

void SwitchToVehicle()
{
    playerInput.actions = vehicleAsset;  // swap the entire asset
    // PlayerInput re-subscribes to the new asset automatically
}

void SwitchToPlayer()
{
    playerInput.actions = playerAsset;
}
```

**When would you have two assets?**
- When two team members work on input simultaneously (merge conflicts)
- When modular DLC adds entirely new control schemes
- Almost never in a typical game

# Part 5: Quick Reference

## Class Summary

| Class | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|

## Notification Behavior Comparison

| Mode | Signature | Auto-wired | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SendMessages` | `OnAction(InputValue v)` | Yes (by name) | Quick prototyping |
| `BroadcastMessages` | `OnAction(InputValue v)` | Yes (by name) | Child component handlers |
| `InvokeUnityEvents` | `OnAction(CallbackContext ctx)` | Inspector drag | Visual wiring, clarity |
| `InvokeCSharpEvents` | `OnAction(CallbackContext ctx)` | Code subscription | Full code control |

---

## Binding Path Format

```
"<DeviceType>/controlName"

Examples:
"<Keyboard>/space"           spacebar
"<Keyboard>/w"               W key
"<Mouse>/leftButton"         left mouse button
"<Mouse>/delta"              mouse movement (Vector2)
"<Gamepad>/buttonSouth"      A button (Xbox) / X button (PlayStation)
"<Gamepad>/leftStick"        left analog stick (Vector2)
"<Gamepad>/leftTrigger"      left trigger (float 0-1)
"<Touchscreen>/primaryTouch/position"  finger position (Vector2)
```

---

## CallbackContext — What You Can Read

```csharp
void OnAnyAction(InputAction.CallbackContext ctx)
{
    ctx.started           // bool: input just began
    ctx.performed         // bool: input completed
    ctx.canceled          // bool: input ended

    ctx.action            // InputAction: which action fired
    ctx.action.name       // string: "Jump", "Move", etc.
    ctx.control           // InputControl: which button/key fired it
    ctx.control.device    // InputDevice: which device

    ctx.ReadValue<float>()    // read float (button: 0 or 1)
    ctx.ReadValue<Vector2>()  // read Vector2 (stick, WASD composite)
    ctx.ReadValue<bool>()     // read bool
    ctx.time                  // double: timestamp when this fired
}
```

---

## Action Map Switching Cheat Sheet

```csharp
// Recommended — PlayerInput handles cleanup
playerInput.SwitchCurrentActionMap("MapName");

// Low-level — if not using PlayerInput
asset.FindActionMap("Player").Disable();
asset.FindActionMap("UI").Enable();

// Generated class
controls.Player.Disable();
controls.UI.Enable();
```

---

## The Three Ways to Connect Input to Your Code

```
Option 1: PlayerInput + SendMessages
  Pro: Least code, just write OnMove() and it works
  Con: Silent failure if you misspell the method name

Option 2: PlayerInput + InvokeUnityEvents  
  Pro: Visual wiring, clear in Inspector, CallbackContext gives full info
  Con: Requires Inspector setup per action

Option 3: Generated C# Class (no PlayerInput)
  Pro: Full type safety, no magic strings, IntelliSense
  Con: Must regenerate when you change the asset, more boilerplate

Rule of thumb:
  Prototyping / learning     → SendMessages
  Mid-size game              → InvokeUnityEvents
  Large game / team project  → Generated C# class
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Always unsubscribe in OnDisable.**
   ```csharp
   void OnEnable()  { jumpAction.performed += OnJump; }
   void OnDisable() { jumpAction.performed -= OnJump; }  // prevents memory leaks
   ```

2. **Don't subscribe in Update.** Subscribe once in Awake/OnEnable.

3. **Use SwitchCurrentActionMap instead of manually enabling/disabling** when using PlayerInput.

4. **Don't read input in FixedUpdate.** Input callbacks run before Update, not FixedUpdate.
   Store the value in a field in the callback, apply it in FixedUpdate.

5. **Re-generate the C# class after every change** to your .inputactions file.

6. **One InputActionMap active at a time** keeps logic clean and prevents conflicting inputs.

## Part 1: Why the New Input System Exists

### The Old System's Problems

Unity's old `Input.GetKey()` approach had critical limitations:

```csharp
// ❌ OLD WAY — Everything hardcoded and messy
public class OldSpaceshipController : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Update()
    {
        // Hardcoded keys scattered everywhere
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.W))
            Thrust();
        
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space))
            FireWeapon();
        
        float rotation = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal"); // hidden in Project Settings
        RotateShip(rotation);
        
        // Want to support gamepad? Write it all again with different code
        float gamepadThrust = Input.GetAxis("GamepadThrottle");
        
        // Want players to rebind? Nightmare - edit code or write complex rebinding system
    }
}
````

**Problems:**

- **Hardcoded bindings** — Change W to Shift? Edit code everywhere.
- **No rebinding** — Players can't remap Thrust from W to E.
- **Single device** — Keyboard OR gamepad, awkward to support both.
- **No VR/Touch** — Mobile/VR required completely separate code paths.
- **Hidden configuration** — "Horizontal" axis buried in Project Settings.
- **Polling-based** — You check every frame whether input happened or not (wasteful).

### What the New System Solves

Code

```
✅ Action-based      — Define "Thrust" once, bind to W / RB trigger / VR squeeze
✅ Rebindable        — Players change controls at runtime with UI
✅ Multi-device      — Keyboard, gamepad, touch, VR use identical code
✅ Event-driven      — Input fires events only when needed
✅ Type-safe         — Actions defined in assets, can generate C# code
✅ Platform-agnostic — One "FireWeapon" action works everywhere
✅ Organized         — All bindings visible in Inspector, not scattered in code
```

### Key Terms

|Term|Definition|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Input Actions Asset**|`.inputactions` file. Stores all maps, actions, bindings.|`SpaceshipControls.inputactions`|
|**Action Map**|Contextual group of actions (Combat, Navigation). Only one active at a time.|"Combat" map for battle, "Navigation" for flight|
|**Action**|One logical input event (FireWeapon, Thrust, Rotate). Can be Button or Value type.|"FirePrimary" — player shoots|
|**Binding**|Links an action to physical input. Can have multiple per action.|`<Keyboard>/w` or `<Gamepad>/triggerRight`|
|**PlayerInput**|MonoBehaviour component that bridges the asset and your code.|Attached to GameManager GameObject|
|**Callback Context**|Data passed to your event handler (phase, value, device info).|"Fire was pressed" or "Stick angle is 45°"|

---

## Part 3: The Class Hierarchy

Everything in the Input System follows this containment structure:

Code

```
InputActionAsset          ← ScriptableObject, the .inputactions file
  └── InputActionMap      ← Groups actions by context ("Combat", "Navigation")
        └── InputAction   ← One logical input event ("FirePrimary", "Thrust")
              └── InputBinding  ← Path linking action to control
                    └── InputControl  ← Runtime representation of physical button
```

### How It Works Under the Hood

When you create an Input Actions Asset in the Editor, Unity stores it as JSON internally:

JSON

```
{
  "name": "SpaceshipControls",
  "maps": [
    {
      "name": "Combat",
      "actions": [
        {
          "name": "FirePrimary",
          "type": "Button"
        },
        {
          "name": "Aim",
          "type": "Value",
          "expectedControlType": "Vector2"
        }
      ],
      "bindings": [
        {
          "path": "<Keyboard>/w",
          "action": "FirePrimary"
        },
        {
          "path": "<Gamepad>/triggerRight",
          "action": "FirePrimary"
        },
        {
          "path": "<Mouse>/delta",
          "action": "Aim"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

At runtime, this JSON is deserialized into C# objects (`InputActionMap`, `InputAction`, `InputBinding`).

### Core Classes in Action

C#

```
// Load the asset
InputActionAsset spaceship = Resources.Load<InputActionAsset>("SpaceshipControls");

// Get a specific map
InputActionMap combatMap = spaceship.FindActionMap("Combat");

// Get a specific action
InputAction fireAction = spaceship.FindAction("FirePrimary");

// Enable the map (now actions fire when triggered)
combatMap.Enable();

// Check if an action is currently being held
if (fireAction.IsPressed())
    Debug.Log("Fire button is held down RIGHT NOW");

// Read the current value (for continuous inputs like Aim stick)
InputAction aimAction = spaceship.FindAction("Aim");
Vector2 aimDirection = aimAction.ReadValue<Vector2>();
```

---

## Part 4: PlayerInput Component

### What It Does

`PlayerInput` is a **MonoBehaviour** you attach to a GameObject. It's the bridge between your `.inputactions` asset and your code.

**Without PlayerInput (manual approach):**

C#

```
// You must do all this yourself
public class ManualInputSetup : MonoBehaviour
{
    private SpaceshipControlsInputActions _controls;

    void Awake()
    {
        _controls = new SpaceshipControlsInputActions();
        _controls.Enable();
        
        // Subscribe to every action manually
        _controls.Combat.FirePrimary.performed += ctx => FireWeapon();
        _controls.Combat.Aim.performed += ctx => UpdateAim(ctx.ReadValue<Vector2>());
        _controls.Navigation.Throttle.performed += ctx => UpdateThrottle(ctx.ReadValue<float>());
        
        // Handle map switching manually
        // Handle unsubscribing on destroy
        // Track which map is active
    }
}
```

**With PlayerInput (automatic):**

C#

```
// 1. Drag the asset into the Inspector
// 2. Choose a notification behavior
// 3. Wire up your methods (if using UnityEvents)
// Done! PlayerInput handles everything.
```

### Setup Steps

1. **Create a GameObject** (e.g., "GameManager")
2. **Add PlayerInput component** (Add Component → PlayerInput)
3. **Assign your `.inputactions` asset** to the Actions field
4. **Set Default Map** (which action map starts active, e.g., "Navigation")
5. **Choose Behavior** (how it notifies your code)
6. **Wire up in Inspector** (if using UnityEvents)

### PlayerInput Key Properties

C#

```
PlayerInput playerInput = GetComponent<PlayerInput>();

// Current state
InputActionMap currentMap = playerInput.currentActionMap;
string mapName = currentMap.name; // "Combat" or "Navigation"

// Get the asset
InputActionAsset asset = playerInput.actions;

// Check if a required device is missing
if (playerInput.hasMissingRequiredDevices)
    Debug.Log("Gamepad required but not connected!");

// Get player index (for multiplayer games)
int playerNum = playerInput.playerIndex; // 0, 1, 2, 3...

// Get active control scheme
string scheme = playerInput.controlScheme; // "Keyboard&Mouse" or "Gamepad"
```

### PlayerInput Methods

C#

```
// Switch to different action map
playerInput.SwitchCurrentActionMap("Combat");

// Switch control scheme
playerInput.SwitchCurrentControlScheme("Gamepad", Gamepad.current);

// Pause/resume all input processing
playerInput.DeactivateInput();   // stop listening to any input
playerInput.ActivateInput();     // resume listening

// Check what device triggered an action
void OnActionTriggered(InputAction.CallbackContext ctx)
{
    InputControl triggeredControl = ctx.control;
    InputDevice device = ctx.control.device;
    Debug.Log($"Action triggered by {device.name}: {triggeredControl.displayName}");
}
```

## Part 5: Action Types & Callback Context

### Action Types

Each action has a **type** that determines what data it produces:

#### Button — Discrete On/Off Input

C#

```
// Example: FirePrimary action
// In the asset: Action Type = Button
// Bindings: W key, Gamepad Right Trigger, Mouse left button

// In your code:
void OnFirePrimaryPerformed(InputAction.CallbackContext ctx)
{
    if (ctx.performed)  // ← only fires on full press, not release
    {
        GameObject projectile = Instantiate(
            projectilePrefab,
            firePoint.position,
            firePoint.rotation
        );
        projectile.GetComponent<Rigidbody>().velocity = firePoint.forward * bulletSpeed;
    }
}
```

**Phases for Button:**

- `started` — player just pressed the button
- `performed` — button is recognized as pressed (after debounce)
- `canceled` — button is released

#### Value — Continuous Data

C#

```
// Example: Throttle action (engine speed)
// In the asset: Action Type = Value, Control Type = Float
// Bindings: Gamepad Right Trigger (float 0-1), Arrow Up/Down (discrete)

// In your code - continuous value, use in Update
private float _throttleInput;

void OnThrottlePerformed(InputAction.CallbackContext ctx)
{
    _throttleInput = ctx.ReadValue<float>();  // 0 to 1
}

void Update()
{
    // Apply throttle every frame
    float speed = _throttleInput * maxEngineThrust;
    rb.velocity = transform.forward * speed;
}
```

Another Value example:

C#

```
// Example: Aim action (aiming crosshair)
// In the asset: Action Type = Value, Control Type = Vector2
// Bindings: Mouse delta movement, Gamepad Right Stick

private Vector2 _aimInput;

void OnAimPerformed(InputAction.CallbackContext ctx)
{
    _aimInput = ctx.ReadValue<Vector2>();  // -1 to 1, -1 to 1
}

void LateCamera()
{
    // Rotate camera based on aim input
    float horizontalRotation = _aimInput.x * aimSensitivity;
    float verticalRotation = _aimInput.y * aimSensitivity;
    
    cameraRig.Rotate(Vector3.up, horizontalRotation);
    cameraRig.Rotate(Vector3.right, verticalRotation);
}
```

#### PassThrough — Every Frame (Rare)

Used when you need to sample input every single frame without filtering. Almost never needed for games.

### CallbackContext — Everything You Receive

Every input callback receives an `InputAction.CallbackContext` struct with all the details:

C#

```
void OnAnyInput(InputAction.CallbackContext ctx)
{
    // ─── PHASE INFO ─────────────────────────────────
    bool started   = ctx.started;      // true when button first pressed
    bool performed = ctx.performed;    // true when full action recognized
    bool canceled  = ctx.canceled;     // true when button released
    
    // Example for FireSecondary (hold to charge):
    if (ctx.started)
        _chargeStartTime = Time.time;
    
    if (ctx.performed)
        _chargeAmount = Mathf.Clamp(Time.time - _chargeStartTime, 0, maxChargeTime);
    
    if (ctx.canceled)
        FireSecondaryWeapon(_chargeAmount);

    // ─── ACTION INFO ─────────────────────────────────
    InputAction action = ctx.action;          // the action object
    string actionName = ctx.action.name;      // "FirePrimary"

    // ─── DEVICE INFO ─────────────────────────────────
    InputControl control = ctx.control;              // which control triggered this
    InputDevice device = ctx.control.device;         // Keyboard, Mouse, Gamepad
    
    // Example: log what device fired the action
    Debug.Log($"Action '{actionName}' triggered on {device.displayName}");
    // Output: "Action 'FirePrimary' triggered on Keyboard"

    // ─── READ THE VALUE ─────────────────────────────
    float floatVal = ctx.ReadValue<float>();        // for single axis
    Vector2 vec = ctx.ReadValue<Vector2>();         // for 2D input
    bool pressed = ctx.ReadValueAsButton();          // bool interpretation
    
    // Example: read aiming direction
    Vector2 aimDir = ctx.ReadValue<Vector2>();
    Debug.DrawLine(shipCenter, shipCenter + (Vector3)aimDir * 10, Color.green);

    // ─── TIMING ─────────────────────────────────────
    double time = ctx.time;                          // when this fired (seconds)
    
    // Example: measure time between shots
    if (_lastShotTime > 0)
    {
        float timeSinceLastShot = (float)(ctx.time - _lastShotTime);
        Debug.Log($"Time since last shot: {timeSinceLastShot}s");
    }
    _lastShotTime = ctx.time;
}
```

## Part 6: Notification Patterns

`PlayerInput` has four ways to notify your code that an action fired. The `notificationBehavior` property controls which one.

### Pattern 1: Send Messages ❌ (Avoid)

PlayerInput calls `SendMessage("OnActionName", value)` on the same GameObject using reflection.

C#

```
// PlayerInput Behavior: Send Messages

public class SpaceshipOldWay : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Method name MUST match: On<ActionName>
    // PlayerInput finds it automatically via reflection at runtime
    
    public void OnFirePrimary(InputValue value)
    {
        if (value.isPressed)
        {
            // Only has the value, not the full context
            ShootMainWeapon();
        }
    }
    
    public void OnThrottle(InputValue value)
    {
        float throttle = value.Get<float>();
        ApplyEngineThrust(throttle);
    }
}
```

**Pros:**

- Automatic — no wiring needed

**Cons:**

- **Slow** — uses reflection every time
- **Silent failure** — typo the method name and it never calls
- **No type safety** — compile errors won't catch naming mistakes
- **Tight coupling** — must be on same GameObject as PlayerInput
- **Limited info** — no full CallbackContext access

**Avoid this.** Use it only for quick 5-minute prototyping.

### Pattern 2: Broadcast Messages ❌ (Avoid)

Same as Send Messages but searches child GameObjects too.

C#

```
// PlayerInput Behavior: Broadcast Messages

// PlayerInput will call SendMessage on THIS object AND all children
// Even slower due to extra GameObject hierarchy search
```

Even slower than Send Messages. Almost never use this.

### Pattern 3: Invoke Unity Events ✅ (Good)

PlayerInput exposes UnityEvents in the Inspector. You drag methods into slots manually.

C#

```
// PlayerInput Behavior: Invoke Unity Events

public class SpaceshipGameMode : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Wire these in the Inspector by dragging
    
    public void OnFirePrimaryPerformed(InputAction.CallbackContext ctx)
    {
        if (ctx.performed)
        {
            ShootMainWeapon();
        }
    }
    
    public void OnThrottlePerformed(InputAction.CallbackContext ctx)
    {
        if (ctx.performed)
        {
            float throttleAmount = ctx.ReadValue<float>();
            _currentThrottle = throttleAmount;
        }
    }
    
    public void OnScanForEnemiesPerformed(InputAction.CallbackContext ctx)
    {
        if (ctx.performed)
        {
            RadarSystem.instance.FullScan();
        }
    }
}
```

**In Inspector:**

Code

```
PlayerInput component
  └─ Events
       └─ Combat (Action Map)
            ├─ Fire Primary (performed): [SpaceshipGameMode] → OnFirePrimaryPerformed()
            ├─ Throttle (performed): [SpaceshipGameMode] → OnThrottlePerformed()
            └─ Scan For Enemies (performed): [SpaceshipGameMode] → OnScanForEnemiesPerformed()
```

**Pros:**

- Visual feedback — see what's wired in Inspector
- Full CallbackContext — all phase and value info available
- Type-safe — compile error if method deleted
- Clear at a glance — no magic method names

**Cons:**

- Inspector clutter — many actions = many event slots
- Requires manual wiring per action
- Hard to see from code who's handling what

**Best for:** Medium-sized projects, game modes, designers.

### Pattern 4: Invoke C# Events ✅ (Best)

Generate a C# class from your `.inputactions` asset. Subscribe directly in code.

C#

```
// First: In Input Actions asset Inspector, check "Generate C# Class"
// This generates: SpaceshipControlsInputActions.cs

public class SpaceshipController : MonoBehaviour
{
    private SpaceshipControlsInputActions _controls;

    void Awake()
    {
        _controls = new SpaceshipControlsInputActions();
        _controls.Enable();

        // Type-safe subscription — autocomplete works!
        _controls.Combat.FirePrimary.performed += OnFirePrimary;
        _controls.Combat.FireSecondary.performed += OnFireSecondary;
        _controls.Combat.Aim.performed += OnAim;
        _controls.Navigation.Throttle.performed += OnThrottle;
        _controls.Navigation.Rotate.performed += OnRotate;
    }

    void OnDisable()
    {
        // Always unsubscribe to prevent memory leaks
        _controls.Combat.FirePrimary.performed -= OnFirePrimary;
        _controls.Combat.FireSecondary.performed -= OnFireSecondary;
        _controls.Combat.Aim.performed -= OnAim;
        _controls.Navigation.Throttle.performed -= OnThrottle;
        _controls.Navigation.Rotate.performed -= OnRotate;
        _controls.Disable();
    }

    void OnFirePrimary(InputAction.CallbackContext ctx)
    {
        GameObject projectile = Instantiate(mainWeaponPrefab, firePoint.position, Quaternion.identity);
        projectile.GetComponent<Rigidbody>().velocity = fireDirection * bulletSpeed;
    }

    void OnFireSecondary(InputAction.CallbackContext ctx)
    {
        if (ctx.started)
            StartCharging();
        if (ctx.canceled)
            ReleaseCharge();
    }

    void OnAim(InputAction.CallbackContext ctx)
    {
        Vector2 aimInput = ctx.ReadValue<Vector2>();
        fireDirection = (transform.forward + (Vector3)aimInput * aimInfluence).normalized;
    }

    void OnThrottle(InputAction.CallbackContext ctx)
    {
        float throttle = ctx.ReadValue<float>();
        rb.velocity = transform.forward * (throttle * maxSpeed);
    }

    void OnRotate(InputAction.CallbackContext ctx)
    {
        Vector2 rotate = ctx.ReadValue<Vector2>();
        transform.Rotate(Vector3.up, rotate.x * rotationSpeed * Time.deltaTime);
    }
}
```

**Pros:**

- **Type-safe** — autocomplete works, typos are compile errors
- **Fast** — no reflection overhead
- **Full control** — subscribe/unsubscribe as needed
- **Clear** — no hidden Inspector wiring
- **Professional** — used in AAA games

**Cons:**

- Must regenerate class when asset changes
- More boilerplate code
- Less visual than Inspector wiring

**Best for:** Large projects, gameplay code, programming teams, production games.

## Part 7: The InputManager Pattern

This is a **best practice architecture** used in professional projects. It centralizes all input handling into one singleton that exposes clean, high-level events.

### Why Use This Pattern?

**Problem:** If 10 scripts all subscribe directly to InputAction events, they must each:

- Store reference to the input system
- Subscribe in OnEnable / unsubscribe in OnDisable
- Know about action map switching
- Handle phase filtering (ctx.performed? ctx.started?)

**Solution:** One `InputManager` does all that. Other scripts just subscribe to simple events like `OnFirePrimary`.

### The Pattern — Complete InputManager

C#

```
using System;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.InputSystem;

public class InputManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    // ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    // SINGLETON
    // ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    
    public static InputManager instance { get; private set; }

    // ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    // EVENTS — High-level, clean interface for other systems
    // ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    
    // Combat
    public event Action OnFirePrimary;          // player shoots main weapon
    public event Action<float> OnFireSecondary; // player charges secondary (hold duration)
    public event Action<Vector2> OnAim;         // player aims (stick/mouse position)
    
    // Navigation
    public event Action<float> OnThrottle;      // engine speed (0-1)
    public event Action<Vector2> OnRotate;      // ship rotation (x=yaw, y=pitch)
    public event Action OnScanEnemies;          // player scans for hostile ships
    
    // Map switching (called by GameStateManager)
    public event Action<string> OnMapSwitched;  // fired when action map changes

    // ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    // PRIVATE STATE
    // ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    
    private PlayerInput _playerInput;
    private float _secondaryChargeStartTime;

    // ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    // LIFECYCLE
    // ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    void Awake()
    {
        // Singleton setup
        if (instance != null)
        {
            Destroy(gameObject);
            return;
        }
        instance = this;
        DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject);

        // Get PlayerInput component and set behavior
        _playerInput = GetComponent<PlayerInput>();
        _playerInput.notificationBehavior = PlayerNotifications.InvokeUnityEvents;
    }

    // ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    // CALLBACKS — Called by PlayerInput UnityEvents (wired in Inspector)
    // ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    public void OnFirePrimaryPerformed(InputAction.CallbackContext ctx)
    {
        if (ctx.performed)
            OnFirePrimary?.Invoke();
    }

    public void OnFireSecondaryPerformed(InputAction.CallbackContext ctx)
    {
        if (ctx.started)
            _secondaryChargeStartTime = Time.time;
        
        if (ctx.canceled)
        {
            float chargeTime = Time.time - _secondaryChargeStartTime;
            OnFireSecondary?.Invoke(chargeTime);
        }
    }

    public void OnAimPerformed(InputAction.CallbackContext ctx)
    {
        if (ctx.performed)
        {
            Vector2 aimDir = ctx.ReadValue<Vector2>();
            OnAim?.Invoke(aimDir);
        }
    }

    public void OnThrottlePerformed(InputAction.CallbackContext ctx)
    {
        if (ctx.performed)
        {
            float throttleValue = ctx.ReadValue<float>();
            OnThrottle?.Invoke(throttleValue);
        }
    }

    public void OnRotatePerformed(InputAction.CallbackContext ctx)
    {
        if (ctx.performed)
        {
            Vector2 rotateInput = ctx.ReadValue<Vector2>();
            OnRotate?.Invoke(rotateInput);
        }
    }

    public void OnScanForEnemiesPerformed(InputAction.CallbackContext ctx)
    {
        if (ctx.performed)
            OnScanEnemies?.Invoke();
    }

    // ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    // PUBLIC METHODS — For GameStateManager or menu systems
    // ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    public void SwitchToMap(string mapName)
    {
        InputActionMap map = _playerInput.actions.FindActionMap(mapName);
        if (map == null)
        {
            Debug.LogWarning($"[InputManager] Map '{mapName}' not found in asset.");
            return;
        }
        _playerInput.SwitchCurrentActionMap(mapName);
        OnMapSwitched?.Invoke(mapName);
    }

    public bool IsMapActive(string mapName)
    {
        return _playerInput.currentActionMap.name == mapName;
    }

    public void PauseInput() => _playerInput.DeactivateInput();
    public void ResumeInput() => _playerInput.ActivateInput();
}
```

### Using the InputManager

Any script can now react to input cleanly without knowing about the Input System:

C#

```
public class WeaponSystem : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private GameObject mainProjectilePrefab;
    [SerializeField] private Transform firePoint;
    [SerializeField] private float mainBulletSpeed = 50f;

    void OnEnable()
    {
        // Subscribe to clean events — no Input System knowledge
        InputManager.instance.OnFirePrimary += ShootMainWeapon;
        InputManager.instance.OnFireSecondary += ShootSecondaryWeapon;
    }

    void OnDisable()
    {
        // ALWAYS unsubscribe
        InputManager.instance.OnFirePrimary -= ShootMainWeapon;
        InputManager.instance.OnFireSecondary -= ShootSecondaryWeapon;
    }

    void ShootMainWeapon()
    {
        GameObject projectile = Instantiate(mainProjectilePrefab, firePoint.position, Quaternion.identity);
        projectile.GetComponent<Rigidbody>().velocity = firePoint.forward * mainBulletSpeed;
    }

    void ShootSecondaryWeapon(float chargeTime)
    {
        float damage = Mathf.Lerp(50f, 500f, chargeTime / 3f); // charges up to 3 seconds
        Debug.Log($"Secondary weapon fired! Charge: {chargeTime:F2}s, Damage: {damage:F0}");
    }
}
```

Another example:

C#

```
public class ShipController : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private Rigidbody rb;
    [SerializeField] private float maxSpeed = 100f;
    [SerializeField] private float rotationSpeed = 45f;

    private Vector2 _currentRotation;
    private float _currentThrottle;

    void OnEnable()
    {
        InputManager.instance.OnThrottle += UpdateThrottle;
        InputManager.instance.OnRotate += UpdateRotation;
    }

    void OnDisable()
    {
        InputManager.instance.OnThrottle -= UpdateThrottle;
        InputManager.instance.OnRotate -= UpdateRotation;
    }

    void Update()
    {
        // Apply throttle every frame
        float speed = _currentThrottle * maxSpeed;
        rb.velocity = transform.forward * speed;

        // Apply rotation every frame
        transform.Rotate(Vector3.up, _currentRotation.x * rotationSpeed * Time.deltaTime);
        transform.Rotate(Vector3.right, _currentRotation.y * rotationSpeed * Time.deltaTime);
    }

    void UpdateThrottle(float value) => _currentThrottle = value;
    void UpdateRotation(Vector2 value) => _currentRotation = value;
}
```

### Benefits of This Pattern

- **Decoupling** — WeaponSystem doesn't know about InputSystem
- **Single responsibility** — InputManager handles input, systems handle gameplay
- **Easy map switching** — One place to control what's active
- **Reusability** — Use InputManager in any scene
- **Testability** — Can mock events for testing
- **Scalability** — Adding 50 more systems doesn't complicate input

## Part 8: Action Map Switching

Only one action map should be active at a time. Switching them lets you change what inputs are available based on game state.

### Example: Spaceship Game States

Code

```
Game State: SpaceExploration → Navigation map (Throttle, Rotate, Scan)
Game State: InCombat         → Combat map (FirePrimary, FireSecondary, Aim)
Game State: Docking          → Docking map (AlignShip, RequestEntry, CancelDocking)
Game State: PauseMenu        → UI map (Navigate, Confirm, Cancel, Inventory)
```

### GameStateManager Example

C#

```
public enum GameState { Exploring, Combat, Docking, Paused, Menu }

public class GameStateManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    public static GameStateManager instance { get; private set; }
    
    public event Action<GameState> OnStateChanged;
    
    private GameState _currentState;

    void Awake()
    {
        if (instance != null) { Destroy(gameObject); return; }
        instance = this;
    }

    public void SetState(GameState newState)
    {
        if (_currentState == newState) return;
        
        _currentState = newState;
        OnStateChanged?.Invoke(newState);

        // Switch input maps based on state
        switch (newState)
        {
            case GameState.Exploring:
                InputManager.instance.SwitchToMap("Navigation");
                Time.timeScale = 1f;
                Debug.Log("🚀 Exploring space");
                break;

            case GameState.Combat:
                InputManager.instance.SwitchToMap("Combat");
                Time.timeScale = 1f;
                Debug.Log("⚔️ Combat started!");
                break;

            case GameState.Docking:
                InputManager.instance.SwitchToMap("Docking");
                Time.timeScale = 0.1f; // slow for precision
                Debug.Log("🔧 Docking sequence");
                break;

            case GameState.Paused:
            case GameState.Menu:
                InputManager.instance.SwitchToMap("UI");
                Time.timeScale = 0f;
                Debug.Log("⏸️ Paused");
                break;
        }
    }

    public GameState GetCurrentState() => _currentState;
}
```

### Subscribe to State Changes

C#

```
public class UIManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private GameObject combatHUD;
    [SerializeField] private GameObject navigationHUD;
    [SerializeField] private GameObject pauseMenu;

    void Start()
    {
        GameStateManager.instance.OnStateChanged += HandleStateChange;
    }

    void HandleStateChange(GameState newState)
    {
        // Hide all HUDs
        combatHUD.SetActive(false);
        navigationHUD.SetActive(false);
        pauseMenu.SetActive(false);

        // Show appropriate HUD
        switch (newState)
        {
            case GameState.Exploring:
                navigationHUD.SetActive(true);
                break;
            case GameState.Combat:
                combatHUD.SetActive(true);
                break;
            case GameState.Paused:
                pauseMenu.SetActive(true);
                break;
        }
    }
}
```

## Part 9: Real Code Walkthrough - Spaceship Game

### Full Example: Complete Spaceship Combat

**Step 1: Create the Input Actions Asset**

In Unity Editor:

1. Right-click in Assets → Create → Input Actions
2. Name it: `SpaceshipControls`
3. Define maps and actions:

Code

```
SpaceshipControls.inputactions
├── Combat (Action Map)
│   ├── FirePrimary (Button)
│   │   ├── Keyboard: W
│   │   └── Gamepad: Right Trigger
│   ├── FireSecondary (Button)
│   │   ├── Keyboard: Q
│   │   └── Gamepad: Left Trigger
│   └── Aim (Value - Vector2)
│       ├── Keyboard: Mouse
│       └── Gamepad: Right Stick
│
└── Navigation (Action Map)
    ├── Throttle (Value - Float)
    │   ├── Keyboard: Up/Down arrows
    │   └── Gamepad: Left Stick Y
    ├── Rotate (Value - Vector2)
    │   ├── Keyboard: A/D keys
    │   └── Gamepad: Left Stick
    └── Scan (Button)
        ├── Keyboard: Space
        └── Gamepad: Start
```

**Step 2: InputManager.cs**

C#

```
using System;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.InputSystem;

public class InputManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    public static InputManager instance { get; private set; }

    public event Action OnFirePrimary;
    public event Action<float> OnFireSecondary;
    public event Action<Vector2> OnAim;
    public event Action<float> OnThrottle;
    public event Action<Vector2> OnRotate;
    public event Action OnScanRadar;

    private PlayerInput _playerInput;
    private float _chargeStart;

    void Awake()
    {
        if (instance != null) { Destroy(gameObject); return; }
        instance = this;
        DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject);

        _playerInput = GetComponent<PlayerInput>();
        _playerInput.notificationBehavior = PlayerNotifications.InvokeUnityEvents;
    }

    // Combat Map Callbacks
    public void OnFirePrimaryPerformed(InputAction.CallbackContext ctx) 
        => OnFirePrimary?.Invoke();

    public void OnFireSecondaryPerformed(InputAction.CallbackContext ctx)
    {
        if (ctx.started) _chargeStart = Time.time;
        if (ctx.canceled) OnFireSecondary?.Invoke(Time.time - _chargeStart);
    }

    public void OnAimPerformed(InputAction.CallbackContext ctx)
        => OnAim?.Invoke(ctx.ReadValue<Vector2>());

    // Navigation Map Callbacks
    public void OnThrottlePerformed(InputAction.CallbackContext ctx)
        => OnThrottle?.Invoke(ctx.ReadValue<float>());

    public void OnRotatePerformed(InputAction.CallbackContext ctx)
        => OnRotate?.Invoke(ctx.ReadValue<Vector2>());

    public void OnScanRadarPerformed(InputAction.CallbackContext ctx)
        => OnScanRadar?.Invoke();

    public void SwitchMap(string mapName)
    {
        if (_playerInput.actions.FindActionMap(mapName) != null)
            _playerInput.SwitchCurrentActionMap(mapName);
    }
}
```

**Step 3: WeaponSystem.cs**

C#

```
using UnityEngine;

public class WeaponSystem : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private Transform firePoint;
    [SerializeField] private GameObject projectilePrefab;
    [SerializeField] private float bulletSpeed = 50f;
    [SerializeField] private float maxSecondaryDamage = 500f;

    void OnEnable()
    {
        InputManager.instance.OnFirePrimary += FireMain;
        InputManager.instance.OnFireSecondary += FireSecondary;
    }

    void OnDisable()
    {
        InputManager.instance.OnFirePrimary -= FireMain;
        InputManager.instance.OnFireSecondary -= FireSecondary;
    }

    void FireMain()
    {
        var projectile = Instantiate(
            projectilePrefab,
            firePoint.position,
            firePoint.rotation
        );
        
        projectile.GetComponent<Rigidbody>().velocity = firePoint.forward * bulletSpeed;
        
        Debug.Log("💥 Main weapon fired!");
    }

    void FireSecondary(float chargeTime)
    {
        float chargePercent = Mathf.Clamp01(chargeTime / 2f); // max 2 seconds
        float damage = Mathf.Lerp(50f, maxSecondaryDamage, chargePercent);
        
        Debug.Log($"⚡ Secondary weapon! Charge: {chargePercent * 100:F0}% Damage: {damage:F0}");
        
        // Spawn charged effect at firepoint
        Instantiate(chargeEffectPrefab, firePoint.position, Quaternion.identity);
    }
}
```

**Step 4: ShipController.cs**

C#

```
using UnityEngine;

public class ShipController : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private Rigidbody rb;
    [SerializeField] private float maxSpeed = 100f;
    [SerializeField] private float rotationSpeed = 45f;

    private Vector2 _moveInput;
    private Vector2 _rotateInput;
    private float _throttleInput;

    void OnEnable()
    {
        InputManager.instance.OnThrottle += SetThrottle;
        InputManager.instance.OnRotate += SetRotation;
        InputManager.instance.OnAim += SetAimDirection;
    }

    void OnDisable()
    {
        InputManager.instance.OnThrottle -= SetThrottle;
        InputManager.instance.OnRotate -= SetRotation;
        InputManager.instance.OnAim -= SetAimDirection;
    }

    void Update()
    {
        // Apply thrust
        float speed = _throttleInput * maxSpeed;
        rb.velocity = transform.forward * speed;

        // Apply rotation
        transform.Rotate(Vector3.up, _rotateInput.x * rotationSpeed * Time.deltaTime);
        transform.Rotate(Vector3.right, -_rotateInput.y * rotationSpeed * Time.deltaTime);
    }

    void SetThrottle(float value) => _throttleInput = Mathf.Clamp01(value);
    void SetRotation(Vector2 value) => _rotateInput = value;
    void SetAimDirection(Vector2 value) => _moveInput = value;
}
```

**Step 5: RadarSystem.cs**

C#

```
using UnityEngine;

public class RadarSystem : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private float scanRange = 500f;
    [SerializeField] private LayerMask enemyLayer;

    void OnEnable()
    {
        InputManager.instance.OnScanRadar += PerformScan;
    }

    void OnDisable()
    {
        InputManager.instance.OnScanRadar -= PerformScan;
    }

    void PerformScan()
    {
        Collider[] enemies = Physics.OverlapSphere(transform.position, scanRange, enemyLayer);
        
        Debug.Log($"🔍 Radar scan complete! Found {enemies.Length} targets.");
        
        foreach (var enemy in enemies)
        {
            Debug.Log($"  - Enemy detected: {enemy.name} at {Vector3.Distance(transform.position, enemy.transform.position):F0}m");
        }
    }
}
```

**Step 6: Inspector Setup**

1. Create GameObject "GameManager"
2. Add PlayerInput component
3. Assign SpaceshipControls asset
4. Set Behavior to "Invoke Unity Events"
5. Wire up all methods:

Code

```
PlayerInput Events
├─ Combat Map
│  ├─ Fire Primary → InputManager.OnFirePrimaryPerformed()
│  ├─ Fire Secondary → InputManager.OnFireSecondaryPerformed()
│  └─ Aim → InputManager.OnAimPerformed()
└─ Navigation Map
   ├─ Throttle → InputManager.OnThrottlePerformed()
   ├─ Rotate → InputManager.OnRotatePerformed()
   └─ Scan Radar → InputManager.OnScanRadarPerformed()
```

### Complete Data Flow

Code

```
Player presses W (or Gamepad RB)
    ↓
Input System detects Keyboard/w or Gamepad/triggerRight
    ↓
Input System finds "FirePrimary" action
    ↓
FirePrimary action fires: performed phase
    ↓
PlayerInput calls: InputManager.OnFirePrimaryPerformed(ctx)
    ↓
InputManager.OnFirePrimary event fires
    ↓
All subscribers called:
  - WeaponSystem.FireMain()
    ↓
    GameObject projectile created at firePoint
    Velocity set to forward * bulletSpeed
    Debug log: "💥 Main weapon fired!"
```

## Part 10: Advanced Topics

### Composite Bindings: Multiple Keys as One Input

Code

```
Navigate action (Value - Vector2)
  ├─ Composite: 2D Vector
  │   ├─ Up: W
  │   ├─ Down: S
  │   ├─ Left: A
  │   └─ Right: D
  │
  └─ Binding: Gamepad Left Stick
```

The Input System automatically converts WASD to a Vector2:

- W = `(0, 1)`
- A = `(-1, 0)`
- W + D = `(0.707, 0.707)` (normalized diagonal)
- Stick automatically outputs Vector2

**Code (same for both):**

C#

```
void OnNavigate(InputAction.CallbackContext ctx)
{
    Vector2 direction = ctx.ReadValue<Vector2>();
    
    // Works for both WASD and gamepad stick
    rb.velocity = direction * speed;
}
```

### Runtime Rebinding: Let Players Change Controls

C#

```
public class RebindingUI : MonoBehaviour
{
    public void StartRebinding(string actionName)
    {
        InputAction action = InputManager.instance.GetAction(actionName);
        
        var rebind = action.PerformInteractiveRebinding()
            .OnComplete(operation =>
            {
                string newPath = operation.action.bindings[0].effectivePath;
                Debug.Log($"{actionName} rebound to: {newPath}");
                
                // Save to PlayerPrefs
                PlayerPrefs.SetString($"Binding_{actionName}", newPath);
                
                operation.Dispose();
            })
            .Start();
    }
}
```

### Checking Current Input State

C#

```
// Is Fire button currently held?
if (InputManager.instance.IsFirePressed())
    Debug.Log("Holding fire");

// Get current rotation value
Vector2 currentRotate = InputManager.instance.GetRotationInput();

// Check which map is active
if (InputManager.instance.IsMapActive("Combat"))
    Debug.Log("In combat mode");
```

### Multiple Players (Multiplayer)

C#

```
// Each player gets its own PlayerInput
public class MultiplayerSetup : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        // Player 1
        var player1Prefab = Instantiate(playerPrefab);
        player1Prefab.GetComponent<PlayerInput>().playerIndex = 0;

        // Player 2
        var player2Prefab = Instantiate(playerPrefab);
        player2Prefab.GetComponent<PlayerInput>().playerIndex = 1;
    }
}
```

## Part 11: Quick Reference

### Setup Checklist

Code

```
☐ Install Input System from Package Manager
☐ Create .inputactions asset (SpaceshipControls.inputactions)
☐ Define Action Maps (Combat, Navigation, UI)
☐ Define Actions in each map (FirePrimary, Throttle, etc.)
☐ Create Bindings (W, Gamepad RB, Mouse, etc.)
☐ Generate C# class (or skip if using PlayerInput)
☐ Create InputManager.cs
☐ Add PlayerInput to GameObject
☐ Assign .inputactions asset to PlayerInput
☐ Set Default Map (Navigation, Combat, etc.)
☐ Set Behavior to "Invoke Unity Events"
☐ Wire up methods in Inspector
☐ Create game systems that subscribe to InputManager events
```

### Quick Template

C#

```
// 1. Create InputManager singleton
public class InputManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    public static InputManager instance { get; private set; }
    
    public event Action OnFirePrimary;
    public event Action<float> OnThrottle;
    
    // Wire these in Inspector
    public void OnFirePrimaryPerformed(InputAction.CallbackContext ctx)
        => OnFirePrimary?.Invoke();
}

// 2. Subscribe in game systems
public class MySystem : MonoBehaviour
{
    void OnEnable()
        => InputManager.instance.OnFirePrimary += DoSomething;
    
    void OnDisable()
        => InputManager.instance.OnFirePrimary -= DoSomething;
    
    void DoSomething() { /* gameplay */ }
}
```

### Binding Paths

Code

```
<Keyboard>/space              Spacebar
<Keyboard>/w                  W key
<Keyboard>/a                  A key
<Mouse>/delta                 Mouse movement (Vector2)
<Mouse>/leftButton            Left click
<Gamepad>/triggerRight        Right trigger (0-1)
<Gamepad>/triggerLeft         Left trigger (0-1)
<Gamepad>/rightStick          Right stick (Vector2)
<Gamepad>/buttonSouth         A/X button
<Gamepad>/buttonNorth         Y/Triangle button
<Gamepad>/dpad/up             D-pad up
<Touchscreen>/primaryTouch    Touch position (Vector2)
```

### Decision Tree

**Should I use InputManager pattern?**

Code

```
Game size:
  ├─ Solo project (1-2 scripts)        → Optional, can subscribe directly
  ├─ Medium (5-10 scripts)             → Recommended
  ├─ Large (20+ scripts)               → Required
  └─ Team/production                   → Required
```

**Which notification pattern?**

Code

```
Requirements:
  ├─ Need all phase info (started/performed/canceled)  → UnityEvents or C# Events
  ├─ Want visual clarity in Inspector                   → UnityEvents
  ├─ Maximum code control                               → C# Events
  ├─ 5-minute prototype                                 → SendMessages
  └─ Professional game                                  → InputManager + UnityEvents
```

### Troubleshooting

|Problem|Cause|Fix|
|---|---|---|
|Action never fires|Wrong action map active|Call `SwitchToMap()`|
|Callbacks not called|Not wired in Inspector|Drag InputManager into event slots|
|Memory leak on scene change|Not unsubscribing|Add unsubscribe in OnDisable|
|Typo in method name (SendMessages)|Silent failure|Check method name: `On<ActionName>`|
|Gamepad doesn't work|No gamepad binding|Add binding: `<Gamepad>/triggerRight`|
|Value always 0|Wrong action type|Ensure action is "Value" not "Button"|
|Can't rebind|Need runtime rebinding code|Use `PerformInteractiveRebinding()`|

### Common Mistakes

❌ **Don't:**

C#

```
// Don't subscribe in Update
void Update()
{
    InputManager.instance.OnFire += DoThing;  // BAD: subscribes every frame!
}

// Don't forget to unsubscribe
void OnDisable() { } // BAD: memory leak!

// Don't access Input System directly if using InputManager
if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.W))  // BAD: bypasses InputManager
    MoveForward();
```

✅ **Do:**

C#

```
// Subscribe in OnEnable, unsubscribe in OnDisable
void OnEnable()
    => InputManager.instance.OnFire += DoThing;

void OnDisable()
    => InputManager.instance.OnFire -= DoThing;

// Use InputManager events consistently
InputManager.instance.OnThrottle += ApplyThrust;
```

## Summary

The New Input System provides:

- **Flexible, rebindable controls** via `.inputactions` assets
- **Event-driven architecture** instead of polling Input.GetKey()
- **Multi-device support** (keyboard, gamepad, touch, VR)
- **Clean separation** between input logic and gameplay logic

**Best Practice: InputManager Pattern**

- One singleton manages all input
- Exposes high-level C# events
- Other scripts subscribe to clean events
- Decoupled, testable, professional, scalable

**Key Insight:** Stop thinking about **keys and buttons**. Think about **player intentions**: Fire, Thrust, Rotate, Scan. Map those to controls in an asset, not code. Let the Input System handle the complexity of devices and rebinding.
